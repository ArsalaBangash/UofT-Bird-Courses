    Provides a general-case interface for Requests sessions to contact HTTP and

    usually be created by the :class:`Session <Session>` class under the
    covers.

    :param pool_connections: The number of urllib3 connection pools to cache.
    :param pool_maxsize: The maximum number of connections to save in the pool.
    :param max_retries: The maximum number of retries each connection
        should attempt. Note, this applies only to failed DNS lookups, socket
        connections and connection timeouts, never to requests where data has
        made it to the server. By default, Requests does not retry failed
