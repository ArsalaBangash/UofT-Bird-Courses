    We prefer IPv4 so that we don't change behavior from previous IPv4-only

    support IPv6 connections.

    If the optional port number is provided, only IPs that listen on the given

        A single IP address, as a string. If any IPv4 address is found, one is
        returned. Otherwise, if any IPv6 address is found, one is returned. If
        neither, then None is returned.
